# CLEANING-NASHVILLE-HOUSING-DATASET-USING-SQL-SERVERL-SEVER
These project was conducted to improve my data cleaning skills and further create  a clean dataset that is useable for analysis.
The dataset was gotten from kaggle and imported into the sql sever.
The data cleaning process includes;
 1. Checking out the Dataset columns and rows
 2. Standardized the Date format
 3. populated some columns with null values using the primary key as a reference.
 4. Breaking out `columns with multiple information into individual columns
 5. Removed duplicates
 6. Deleted unused columns
with these few steps, the dataset was cleaned up and ready for analysis.
